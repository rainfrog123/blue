2. User Interface (UI) Design
Step 1: Select Property
* Dropdown Selection:
   * Alt_CM
   * Alt_PR
* Based on the property selected, only relevant room types should be displayed in the next step.
________________


Step 2: Type of Calculation (Dropdown Selection)
1. New Booking
2. Booking Extension (for extending an existing stay)
3. New Booking with Room Type Change (if switching room types mid-stay)
________________


Step 3A: Inputs for New Booking
* Check-in Date (Calendar Picker)
* Check-out Date (Calendar Picker)
* Capacity (Dropdown: "1 Person" or "2 Persons")
   * If capacity = 2 persons, apply a 20% surcharge to the base room rate.
* Room Type (Dropdown, filtered by selected property):
   * Alt_CM: Flexie, Flexie Plus, Ensuite Single, Ensuite Standard, Ensuite Plus
   * Alt_PR: Flexie, Flexie XL, Ensuite Single, Ensuite Standard, Ensuite King/Twin
* Extra Discounts (Numeric input with "%" at the end)
* Add Room Type Change? (Yes/No toggle → If "Yes," go to Step 4A)
________________


Step 3B: Inputs for Booking Extension
* Original Check-in Date (Calendar Picker)
* Original Check-out Date (Calendar Picker)
* New Check-out Date (Calendar Picker)
* Change Room Type During Extension? (Yes/No toggle → If "Yes," go to Step 4B)
* Apply Long-Stay Discount for Extension? (Checkbox to enable/disable the 7-day rule override if needed)
💡 Logic:
* The app should automatically detect the date of calculation and compare it to the original check-in date to determine if the extension qualifies for long-stay discounts (within 7 days of check-in).
* The manual override checkbox allows staff to apply or disable the 7-day rule in case the calculation needs to be backdated or adjusted manually.
________________


Step 4A: Inputs for Room Type Change (New Booking Scenario)
* Number of Room Type Changes (Dropdown: 1, 2, or 3 changes)
* For Each Room Type Change (up to 3):
   * Date of Room Type Change (Calendar Picker)
   * New Room Type (Dropdown, filtered by selected property)
   * New Capacity (if different) (Dropdown, +20% surcharge if 2 persons)
   * Extra Discounts for New Room Type (if applicable)
💡 Note: If there is a room type change within the same booking, long-term discounts still apply based on total stay duration.
________________


Step 4B: Inputs for Room Type Change (Booking Extension Scenario)
* Number of Room Type Changes (Dropdown: 1, 2, or 3 changes)
* For Each Room Type Change (up to 3):
   * New Room Type (After Original Check-out Date) (Dropdown, filtered by selected property)
   * New Capacity (if different) (Dropdown, +20% surcharge if 2 persons)
   * Extra Discounts for Extended Period (if applicable)
💡 Logic:
* If the stay is extended in the same room type, apply one continuous pricing calculation.
* If the stay is extended with a room type change, split the calculation into separate periods, one for each room type.
* Long-stay discounts still apply across all periods if the extension is within 7 days of check-in, or if the manual override checkbox is enabled.

3. Pricing Calculation Logic
1. Determine Room Rates Based on Property & Seasonality
   * Fetch the seasonal rate (High, Medium, Low) based on room type, property, and booking dates.
2. Apply Capacity-Based Pricing Adjustment
   * If Capacity = 2 persons, apply 20% surcharge to the base room rate.
3. Apply Long-Stay Discount
   * Automatically check if the extension is within 7 days of check-in and apply the appropriate long-stay discount if applicable.
   * If the manual override checkbox is selected, the long-stay discount is applied regardless of the actual date.
4. Long-stay discount tiers:
   * 9-18 nights → 20% discount
   * 19-28 nights → 35% discount
   * 29+ nights → 50% discount
5. Apply Promo & Manual Discounts
   * Apply any promo codes or manual discounts (5-15%) entered by staff.
6. Calculate Final Price
   * Subtotal = (Room Rate × Nights per Room Type) - Discounts
   * VAT (7%) = Subtotal × 1.07
   * Final Total Price (THB) = Subtotal + VAT

4. Output & Summary Display
* All prices should be displayed in Thai Baht (THB).
* The summary should be clean and relevant based on the type of calculation (New Booking, Extension, Room Type Change).
* The number of nights should be displayed in the same row as the room type period, after the date range.
